# Challenge2 - "Portfolio"

## Description

I was tasked with my second challenge to make my own portfolio.

- I used W3school and youtube to assist me on completing this challenge.
- I was able to problem solve and fix code.
- I learned how to fix constant errors.
- I learned how to clean up HTML and CSS code.
- I learned how todo new transions.
- I attempted some JavaScript ( not working haha)

I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.

## User Story

- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of  work samples
-SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to     sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I like to push myself , I feel like I may have pushed to hard to put out a Portfolio 
that I could be proud of , I look forward to updating it over the following weeks. Enabling 
working JavaScript would be nice too. 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application after I edited the code.
